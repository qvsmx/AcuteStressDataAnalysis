# AcuteStressDataAnalysis
These are the scripts (mainly written in R) used for the 4 manuscripts included in Rachel Corr's dissertation analyses. 
Because data used are protected, no data files are uploaded publically on git, but information is available upon request.

Across these files, "PV" or "TotPolyJVQ5" is frequently used to represent polyvictimization and "STAIT" is the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait scale.

## Chapter 2 - Stress RLMs
Chapter 2 of my dissertation was previously published in *[NeuroImage: Clinical](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102543)*.
**MISTStatsNovember_Revised.R** contains the majority of the demographic analyses conducted for this paper, as well as the robust linear models run on extracted ROI data.
