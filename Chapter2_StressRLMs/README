This repo contains the final assignment for Rachel Corr for the Neuroanalytics course.

Because the data for my subjects is private, I have created randomized data for
each of the variables I'm looking at - which means the graphs/statistical results 
generated will not match the graphs I display in class, but I can upload those
figures/results to Sakai if desired. 

The code was written out in 3 main steps: 

    1. ExtractFromMIST.R - this does not need to be run since I uploaded the random
    results file, but originally this script took the fMRI activity output for 
    my ROIs from the FSL software output as well as other demographic or 
    physiological data from a redcap from excel and combined it into one excel sheet.
    For the purposes of testing my data - the output of this sheet would be the
    "MISTReformatedDataRandom.xlsx" sheet currently uploaded. 
    
    2. MISTStats.R - this script takes the reformated data from that 
    "MISTReformatedDataRandom.xlsx" output and runs a series of data analyses
    including tests showing heart rate and self-reported stress ratings (with 
    the real data) significantly changed after stress and robust linear regressions
    with Sex, Age, Change in HRV,Cortisol Responder Status, and Trait Anxiety (STAIT)
    predicting activity in each of my ROIs. It outputs 2 .txt files with statistical
    results and "MISTReformatedDataStatsRandom.xlsx" which shows the includes
    for each lmrob model. 
    
    3. MISTGraphs.R - this script takes the output from the prior 2 scripts and 
    creates the graphs seen in my presentation and saves them as .png files.
